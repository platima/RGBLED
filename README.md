# RGB LED Adventures
This is starting with my 8x8 WS2812B project as shown on my channel [https://youtu.be/@PlatimaTinkers](https://youtube.com/@PlatimaTinkers)

I started this as I think all the current options are pretty crap designs, or overpriced.

## Goals
* Easy to physically mount
* Easy to chain
* Make use of modern power/comms like USB-C
* Cost effective aka no massive markup
* Supports multiple SOCs/MCUs
* Overcome FPS issues with big arrays via onboard controllers
* Self-documenting with silkscreen
* Open-source
* Fun

## Notes
### 2023-12-21
- USB-C is only for chaining DIN/DOUT and power
- There is a 0-ohm resistor to isolate the DIN for the sake of adding multiple controllers.
- The mounts are 2mm, spaced 8mm in, 16mm across, and two per side so it can be physically stable in any configuration.
